# Introduction

[Noiz](https://github.com/ElliottjPierce/noiz) is a simple, configurable, blazingly fast noise library built for and with [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy).

The primary goal of noiz is to provide high performance implementations of noise algorithms through a *very* configurable interface.
Because noiz is so configurable, it can be difficult to learn compared to other noise libraries.
That's where this book comes in!

By the end of this short book, you will:

- know how to use noiz in your own projects,
- understand how to configure different noise kinds,
- be familiar with what different kinds of noise looks like,
- have an intuition for how noise is implemented,
- get an idea of how to implement custom kinds of noise

If you see anything wrong with this book: unclear explanations, undocumented items, typos, etc, please open an issue on github!
