This is a list of places that teach how noise actually works mathematically.
This background can be helpful for debugging any artifacting, etc, that may appear.

- [This](https://iquilezles.org/articles/) website covers lots of cool math and some noise implementations.
- [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxUY42r_6Cg&t=619s) video visually explains value and perlin noise.
- [This](https://muugumuugu.github.io/bOOkshelF/generative%20art/simplexnoise.pdf) paper explains simplex noise.

This list is not at all exhaustive but hopefully provides enough context to get you started if you're curious.
