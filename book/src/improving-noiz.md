# Improving Noiz

Noiz is open source.
If you feel something is missing, please open an issue or pull request.

There's still lots more that can be added here:

- GPU support,
- Custom RNGs,
- Reflection based noise types
- (and more)

At the same time, I don't want to volunteer my time for features nobody needs.
So please make issues for any feature requests you may have etc.

With any luck, we can make `Noiz` the number one noise library for rust!
